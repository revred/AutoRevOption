# WP09 — Convex Debit Verticals (BCS/BPS)

**Goal:** Catalyst‑driven bets with debit ≤ $800, target 2–3x.

## Tasks
- Template builder (0.55–0.65 Δ lower leg, +10–15% upper).
- Event linking (earnings, CPI/Fed); exit 60–70% or T+5.
- Backtest harness (basic).

## Deliverables
- `ConvexEngine.cs`, sample scenarios.
