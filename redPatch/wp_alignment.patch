# WP05 — Monday Readiness (E2E)
**Goal:** Be operational on Mondays with a repeatable flow: **Monitor ➜ Select ➜ Write/Stage ➜ Execute (paper) ➜ Roll ➜ Close**, with full audit & safety.

## Scope
- Covers *weekday open* routine, with emphasis on Mondays.
- Applies to **paper** first, then **live** after passing gates.
- Execution is optional; staging allowed if funds/leverage not admissible.

## Inputs
- `AutoRevOption.Monitor` MCP (read-only): `get_account_summary`, `get_positions`, `get_option_positions`, `get_account_greeks`.
- `AutoRevOption.Minimal` MCP (selection): `scan_candidates`, `validate_candidate`, `verify_candidate`.
- Event feeds: earnings, FOMC, CPI/PCE (per SelectTVC spec).

## Deliverables (Definition of Done)
- [ ] **Morning Snapshot**: JSON under `logs/snapshots/YYYY-MM-DD/` (health, greeks, exposure).
- [ ] **Selection Artifacts**: TVC JSONs under `logs/tvc/YYYY-MM-DD/` (PASS/FAIL reasons).
- [ ] **Staged Tickets** *(paper mode)*: Execution Cards under `logs/exec/cards/` with `mode=STAGE`.
- [ ] **Paper Trades Executed**: if admissible & allowed in config, place paper orders; artifacts written.
- [ ] **Roll Plan**: file per position under `logs/roll/YYYY-MM-DD/<SYMBOL>_<EXP>.json`.
- [ ] **Close Plan**: candidates for close/TP/stop with rationale.
- [ ] **Audit Bundle**: zipped `logs/**` for the day with a human `DailyReport.md`.

## Tasks
1. **Monitoring**
   - [ ] Implement `/snapshots/morning` command (console & MCP) → writes snapshot JSON.
   - [ ] Verify IBKR TWS connectivity for **paper** (`Port: 7497`).
2. **Selection**
   - [ ] Run `select` verb for SOFI/APP/RKLB/META/AMD/GOOGL with DTE 5–9.
   - [ ] Enforce POP ≥ 75%, Reward/Day ≥ 2.5%, liquidity, IVR, event avoidance.
3. **Write/Stage**
   - [ ] For PASS TVCs, create **Execution Cards** with `mode=STAGE`.
   - [ ] Check admissibility (maint%, defined-risk caps, per-symbol caps, freshness & credit drift).
4. **Execute (Paper)**
   - [ ] If admissible and `mode=EXECUTE_PAPER`, place orders via paper TWS with OCO (TP 50%, SL 2×).
   - [ ] Store broker previews, orderIds, and fills under `logs/fills/`.
5. **Roll Management**
   - [ ] Generate roll cues when Δshort > 0.35 or touch; write roll JSON plan.
6. **Close**
   - [ ] Auto-close at TP hit; list near-expiry actions; handle losers per stop rule.
7. **Reporting**
   - [ ] Compile `DailyReport.md` (+ KPI: POP realized vs expected, P&L, fee drag).

## Test Matrix
| Mode | IBKR | Data | MCP | Expectation |
|------|------|------|-----|-------------|
| Unit | none | mock | n/a | Gates enforced (POP/Reward/IVR/liquidity/events) |
| Dry-run | none | live chain | Select | TVCs produced, no order endpoints |
| Paper | TWS:7497 | live chain | Select+Write | Staged ➜ Executed (paper), OCO attached |
| Live (locked) | TWS:7496 | live chain | Select+Write | **STAGE only** until unblocked by checklist |

## Readiness Checklist (must all be ✅)
- [ ] **Connectivity**: TWS paper reachable; heartbeat stable.
- [ ] **Safety Gates**: Unit tests green; Reward/Day & POP gates correct.
- [ ] **Fees Model**: Brokerage calc validated on 2+ tickers.
|- [ ] **Events Feed**: earnings/FOMC/CPI/PCE wired in TVCs.
|- [ ] **Risk Caps**: per-trade ≤ $800, portfolio defined-risk ≤ 12% NetLiq.
|- [ ] **Artifacts**: snapshots, TVCs, Exec Cards, rolls, fills saved.
|- [ ] **Rollback**: ability to cancel open orders & disable executor quickly.

## Acceptance
- Monday run produces: snapshot, ≥1 PASS TVC, ≥1 staged ticket, and (if allowed) ≥1 executed **paper** position with OCO; roll/close plans emitted; audit bundle archived.

## Notes
- Live trades remain **disabled by default** until Paper SLA is met for a week.
