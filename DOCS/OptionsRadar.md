# OptionsRadar — Spec (Brief)
This repo mirrors the full spec authored in canvas:
- Universe buckets, signal library (PCS/CCS, diagonals, BCS/BPS), risk gates, and MCP hooks (validate → verify → act).
- See `OptionsRadar.yaml` for configurable knobs.
- Console app implements `IAutoRevOption` with a mock; upgrade per WorkPackages.
